2 - Add NavItem component.
- The NavItem should take a url prop and the link text as a child, then render an anchor tag (a) element with that text, and pointing url.

- Modify the Nav component to check that every one of its children is a NavItem. and if not, it should throw an error if any other component type is found.

<Nav>
  <NavItem url='https://google.com'>Google</NavItem>
  <NavItem url='https://slack.com'>Slack</NavItem>
